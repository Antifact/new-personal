            <h4>Hi, I'm Caleb! I'm an apsiring software developer!</h4>
              <p>
                I have been infatuated with web development since I was roughly 15-16, but didn't have the opportunity in school to 
                learn without the need for self-learning. I have studied and graduated with a Diploma of IT from CoderAcademy, a bootcamp 
                offered by the Academy of Information Technology, so I could become qualified and more confident in my technical ability. 
                I also hold a Diploma of Information Technology Networking, provided by TAFE Brisbane, which I graduated in 2018. 
              </p>

              <p>
                I'm currently persuing to start my career in software development, and have created this portfolio project to showcase 
                my current technical ability and continue to add to it.
